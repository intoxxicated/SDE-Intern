Components are the main building blocks for Angular applications. Each component consists of:

An HTML template that declares what renders on the page
A TypeScript class that defines behavior
A CSS selector that defines how the component is used in a template
Optionally, CSS styles applied to the template


#Creating a component using the Angular CLI
ng generate component <component-name>

component selector can be used both as element as well as attribute.

import componets in app.component.ts file to use it everywhere
