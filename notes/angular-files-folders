#src
The src folder serves as the project’s root directory. It is crucial as it contains all the source files and resources required to develop the Angular application. Developers spend most of their time writing and modifying code in the src folder. It is a central hub for all the components and other resources that comprise the application.

#app
Inside the src folder, the app folder represents the main application module. It holds the core functionality of the Angular application. The app folder contains various components, services, directives, and other resources specific to the application. Developers organize and structure their code within the app folder to build the user interface, implement business logic, and handle data manipulation. This is where the majority of the application’s development takes place.

#assets
The assets folder located within the src folder stores static assets that the application requires. These assets can include images, fonts, icons, JSON files, configuration files, or any other files that need to be bundled and served with the application.

#node_modules
The node_modules folder is a crucial part of a project as it plays a fundamental role in managing dependencies. When you install external libraries or packages using a package manager like npm or yarn, these dependencies are stored in the node_modules folder. This folder contains all the necessary code and resources for the installed packages thereby allowing your project with Angular to utilize their functionality.

#angular.json
The angular.json file contains configuration options related to the project’s architecture such as the root folder, build targets, environment settings,entry point, scripts  and more. It allows you to define and customize the behavior of Angular CLI commands such as ng build, ng serve, and ng test.

#package.json
The package.json file includes the following information:
--Project name: The name of the project.
--Version: The version number of the project.
--Description: A brief description of the project.
--Author: The author of the project.
--License: The license under which the project is released.
--Dependencies: A list of packages that are required by the project. These packages are installed when the project is set up and are used by the project at runtime.
--Scripts: A list of scripts that can be run using npm. These scripts can perform tasks such as building the project, running tests, and starting a development server.

#dependencies vs dev-dependencies
--Dependencies: In package.json file, there is an object called dependencies and it consists of all the packages that are used in the project with its version number. So, whenever you install any library that is required in your project that library you can find it in the dependencies object. 
--Dev Dependencies: In package.json file, there is an object called as dev Dependencies and it consists of all the packages that are used in the project in its development phase and not in the production or testing environment with its version number. So, whenever you want to install any library that is required only in your development phase then you can find it in the dev Dependencies object. 

#editorconfig
EditorConfig helps maintain consistent coding styles for multiple developers working on the same project across various editors and IDEs. The EditorConfig project consists of a file format for defining coding styles and a collection of text editor plugins that enable editors to read the file format and adhere to defined styles. EditorConfig files are easily readable and they work nicely with version control systems.
